EDA on Zomato Dataset
Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Zomato dataset, which provides detailed information about restaurants. The aim is to analyze and visualize various aspects of the dataset to derive meaningful insights about restaurant performance, customer preferences, and other related factors.

Dataset
The Zomato dataset contains a wealth of information on restaurants, including:

Restaurant Name: The name of the restaurant.
Location: The city or locality where the restaurant is located.
Cuisine: The type of cuisine offered by the restaurant (e.g., Italian, Chinese).
Average Cost: The average cost of a meal for two people.
Ratings: The rating given to the restaurant, typically on a scale from 1 to 5.
Votes: The number of votes or reviews the restaurant has received.
Files
EDA_on_Zomato_Dataset.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis. It includes data loading, cleaning, and visualization steps.
zomato.csv: This is the raw dataset file used in the analysis. It is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and contains the restaurant data.
README.md: This file provides information about the project and how to use it.

Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1) Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.
2) git clone https://github.com/ansh-sudan/EDA-on-Zomato-Dataset.git
3) Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project folder.
4) cd EDA-on-Zomato-Dataset
5) Install Required Packages: Install the necessary Python libraries for running the Jupyter Notebook. If a requirements.txt file is available, it will list all required packages. If not, you will need to manually
6) install common libraries such as:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter


Usage
To perform the analysis, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the EDA_on_Zomato_Dataset.ipynb file.
jupyter notebook EDA_on_Zomato_Dataset.ipynb
Run the Notebook: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to run the EDA. The notebook includes code for data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.


Key Insights
Throughout the analysis, various insights are uncovered, including:

Ratings Analysis: Examine how restaurant ratings vary across different locations and how they correlate with other features.
Cuisine Distribution: Explore the distribution of different types of cuisines and identify the most popular ones.
Cost vs. Ratings: Analyze the relationship between the average cost of dining and restaurant ratings to understand how cost impacts customer satisfaction.
